    "In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When an exception is encountered, the normal flow of the program is disrupted and Python will raise an exception object. The exception object contains information about the error, such as the type of error and where it occurred in the code.\n",

    "Syntax errors, on the other hand, are errors that occur when the Python interpreter cannot understand the code due to a mistake in the syntax. Syntax errors are typically caught by the interpreter before the code is executed, and they prevent the program from running at all. Examples of syntax errors include misspelled variable names, missing parentheses or quotation marks, or incorrect indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that syntax errors are caught by the interpreter before the code is executed, while exceptions occur during the execution of the code. Additionally, syntax errors are typically caused by mistakes in the code itself, while exceptions can be caused by a variety of factors such as invalid input, missing files, or network errors.\n",
